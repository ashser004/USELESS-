### Project Description
We have created a website which has four interfaces.....Each has it's own unique features .We basically made our random
thoughts into a project . 
1st interface is a "USELESS AI" which gives the perfect replies to all your statements ,
questions , etc. 
2nd interface is a "MYSTICAL CAM" which can predict your future "accurately". 
3rd is game called "FACE
OFF" which basically is a face off with yourself . A lil fun game to play to lighten your mood .
 4th and the last is our
fav one which just a cutesy QR scanner and after scanning it we have a fun surprise after you scan it .
 So to conclude , this is our website in a brief description.
