# XYZ üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: DISRUPT

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Adhwika Nair - CUSAT
- Member 2: Ashmith Babu - CUSAT

### Project Description
We have created a website which has four interfaces... Each has its own unique features.  
We basically made our random thoughts into a project.  

1st interface is a **"USELESS AI"** which gives the perfect replies to all your statements, questions, etc.  
2nd interface is a **"MYSTICAL CAM"** which can predict your future *"accurately"*.  
3rd is a game called **"FACE OFF"** ‚Äî a face-off with yourself. A lil fun game to lighten your mood.  
4th and our favorite is a **cutesy QR scanner**, which reveals a fun surprise after scanning.

So to conclude, this is our website in brief.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To reduce boredom and depression (i guess?).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created this website, hehe.
